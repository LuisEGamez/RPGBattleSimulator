## Description

RPG Battle Simulator is a group project created in Java.\
The aim of the game is to battle between two parties and win.\
Each party is formed by a mixture of two types of characters, Wizards and Warriors.\
Both Wizards and Warriors have Health Points which decrease according to the damage received.\
When either one of the characters loses all Health Points, the character is sent to the Graveyard.

## Installation

## Creating a Party
- The User can choose between creating a party manually or randomly.  
If selected to create manually, the User is asked to choose the type of Character (Wizard or Warrior), the name, \
number of Health Points, number of resources(stamina or mana) and the size of the weapon(strength or intelligence).\
The user may choose to add any number of characters to the party.\
- Otherwise select to create randomly, and a party with a random number of characters will be generated.

- The opponent’s party will always be generated randomly, with the same number of characters as the User’s party.  
If chosen to import a party, both parties will be generated randomly.

## The Battle
- The battle is not turn-based, therefore generating a winner and loser in one battle.
- The loser is sent to the graveyard.
When either party is left without characters to fight, the winner is declared.  
- Enter 0 to exit the program.
